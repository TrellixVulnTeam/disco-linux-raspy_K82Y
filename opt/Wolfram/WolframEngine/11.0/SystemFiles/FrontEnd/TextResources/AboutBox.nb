infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to \
exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby \
assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights \
needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to \
allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility \
to acquire that license before distributing the Program.\

Cell["\<\
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with \
respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is \
intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who \
includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a \
manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. \
Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product \
offering, such Contributor (\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to \
defend and indemnify every other Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") \
against any losses, damages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from \
claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the \
Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such \
Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in \
a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply \
to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual \
property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: \
a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and \
b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the \
Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement \
negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim \
at its own expense.\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product \
offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If \
that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers \
warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are \
such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the \
Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other \
Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a \
court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the \
Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.\

to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim \

is filed. In addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any \
entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that \
the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software \

terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as \

Agreement. IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the \
responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate \

distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was \
received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, \
Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) \
under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) \

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and \
other kinds of works.\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take \
away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General \
Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all \
versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its \
users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License \
for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way \
by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our \
General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom \
to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that \
you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the \
software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can \
do these things.\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these \
rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain \
responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify \
it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or \
for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you \
received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source \
code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) \
assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you \
legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that \
there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' \
sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that \
their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous \
versions.\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified \
versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. \
This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom \
to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the \
area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most \
unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit \
the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in \
other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in \
future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States \
should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on \
general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special \
danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively \
proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to \
render the program non-free.\

\"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\

\"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of \
works, such as semiconductor masks.\

\"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. \
Each licensee is addressed as \"you\". \"Licensees\" and \"recipients\" may \
be individuals or organizations.\

Cell["\<\
To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a \
fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact \
copy. The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the earlier work \
or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\
\>", "LicenseText"],

A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the \
Program.\

Cell["\<\
To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without \
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement \
under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or \
modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or \
without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries \
other activities as well.\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties \
to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer \
network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\" to the \
extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) \
displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there \
is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are \
provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to \
view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user \
commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this \
criterion. \

Cell["1. Source Code.", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for \
making modifications to it. \"Object code\" means any non-source form of a \
work.\

Cell["\<\
A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official \
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of \
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is \
widely used among developers working in that language.\

Cell["\<\
The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other than \
the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a \
Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) \
serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to \
implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to \
the public in source code form. A \"Major Component\", in this context, means \
a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the \
specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a \
compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run \
it.\

object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those \
activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or \
general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used \
unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. \
For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files \
associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared \
libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically \
designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow \
between those subprograms and other parts of the work.\

A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, \
which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are \

reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) \
access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge. \

code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the \
Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third \
party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain \
clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the \
Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding \

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to \

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not \

it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free \
programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things.\

Cell["\<\
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors \
to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These \
restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute \
copies of the library or if you modify it.\

Cell["\<\
For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a \

make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link \
other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the \
recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making \
changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms \
so they know their rights.\

distribute and/or modify the library.\

Cell["\<\
To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no \
warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone \
else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the \
original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be \

Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free \

of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in \
this license.\

Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU \

When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared \

criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax \
criteria for linking other code with the library.\

Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. \

ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser \
license provides advantages in certain special circumstances.\

Cell["\<\
For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the \
widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto \

widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by \
limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General \
Public License.\

Cell["\<\
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with \
respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is \
intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who \
includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a \
manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. \
Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product \
offering, such Contributor (\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to \
defend and indemnify every other Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") \
against any losses, damages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from \
claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the \
Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such \
Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in \
a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply \
to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual \
property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must : \
a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and \
b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the \
Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement \
negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim \
at its own expense.\

Cell["\<\
For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product \
offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If \
that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers \
warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are \
such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the \
Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other \
Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a \
court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the \
Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.\

manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. \

offering, such Contributor (\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to \
defend and indemnify every other Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") \
against any losses, damages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from \
claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the \
Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such \
Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in \
a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply \

property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: \

such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the \

Preamble
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to \
share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended \
to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the \
software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to \
most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program \
whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation \
software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You \
can apply it to your programs, too.\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our \
General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom \
to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you \
wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you \
can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that \
you know you can do these things.\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to \
deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These \
restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute \
copies of the software, or if you modify it.\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or \
for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You \
must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you \
must show them these terms so they know their rights.\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) \
offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute \
and/or modify the software.\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that \
everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the \
software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to \
know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced \
by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We \
wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will \
individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program \
proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be \
licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\

\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice \
placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms \
of this General Public License. The \"Program\", below, refers to any such \
program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program \
or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing \
the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or \
translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included \
without limitation in the term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed \
as \"you\".\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered \
by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program \
is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its \
contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been \
made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the \
Program does.\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code \
as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and \
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and \
disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this \
License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of \
the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may \
at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, \
thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such \
modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you \
also meet all of these conditions:\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that \
you changed the files and the date of any change.\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or \
in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be \
licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this \
License.\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, \
you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most \
ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate \
copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that \
you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under \
these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. \
(Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print \
such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print \
an announcement.)\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable \
sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably \
considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, \
and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as \
separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole \
which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be \
on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to \
the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\
\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your \
rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the \
right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on \
the Program.\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with \
the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or \
distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this \
License.\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under \
Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 \
and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, \
which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a \
medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give \
any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing \
source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding \
source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a \
medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to \
distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is allowed only for \
noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object \
code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b \
above.)\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making \
modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all \
the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface \
definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and \
installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source \
code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in \
either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, \
and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that \
component itself accompanies the executable.\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to \
copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the \
source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, \
even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the \
object code.\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as \
expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, \
sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically \
terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received \
copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses \
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. \
However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the \
Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you \
do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the \
Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of \
this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, \
distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), \
the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to \
copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. \
You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of \
the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance \
by third parties to this License.\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent \
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), \
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or \
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse \
you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to \
satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other \
pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the \
Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit \
royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies \
directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both \
it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the \
Program.\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any \
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and \
the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents \
or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; \
this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free \
software distribution system, which is implemented by public license \
practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of \
software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent \
application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or \
she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee \
cannot impose that choice.\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a \
consequence of the rest of this License.\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain \
countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original \
copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an \
explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so \
that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.  \
In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the \
body of this License.\

9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of \
the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be \
similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address \
new problems or concerns.\

Cell["\<\
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program \
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any \
later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions \
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software \
Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, \
you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs \
whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for \
permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software \
Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make \
exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals of \
preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of \
promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
NO WARRANTY
11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR \
THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE \
STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE \
PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, \
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND \
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND \
PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, \
YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\

Cell["\<\
12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING \
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR \
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, \
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING \
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO \
LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR \

You must change the name(s) of the fonts. This is to ensure the quality of \

Yes. The contract between the Gnome Foundation and Bitstream has provisions \

font family. Please contact us if you have such additions. Note, that in \
general, we will want such additions for the entire family, not just a single \
font, and that you'll have to keep both Gnome and Jim Lyles, Vera's designer, \
happy! To make sense to add glyphs to the font, they must be stylistically in \
keeping with Vera's design. Vera cannot become a \"ransom note\" font. Jim \

This depends on exact details of the software. Most open source systems and \
software (e.g., Gnome, KDE, etc.) are now converting to use fontconfig (see \
http://www.fontconfig.org) to handle font configuration, selection and \
substitution; it has provisions for overriding font names and subsituting \
alternatives. An example is provided by the supplied local.conf file, which \
chooses the family Bitstream Vera for \"sans\", \"serif\" and \"monospace\".  \
Other software (e.g., the XFree86 core server) has other mechanisms for font \
substitution.\

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to \

intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make \
sure the software is free for all its users.\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially \
designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software \
Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we \
suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary \
General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, \
based on the explanations below.\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not \
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have \
the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this \
service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want \
it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free \
programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things.\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors \
to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These \
restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute \
copies of the library or if you modify it.\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a \
fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must \
make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link \
other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the \
recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making \
changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms \
so they know their rights.\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, \
and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, \
distribute and/or modify the library.\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no \
warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone \
else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the \
original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be \
affected by problems that might be introduced by others.\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free \
program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the \
users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent \
holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version \
of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in \
this license.\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU \
General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, \
applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the \
ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in \
order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared \
library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a \
derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License \
therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its \
criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax \
criteria for linking other code with the library.\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it does \
Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. \
It also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over \
competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the \
ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser \
license provides advantages in certain special circumstances.\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the \
widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto \
standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the \
library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as \
widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by \
limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General \
Public License.\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs \
enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For \
example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables \
many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its \
variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' \
freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the \

modified version of the Library.\

0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program \

\"you\".\

Cell["\<\
The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work which has \
been distributed under these terms. A \"work based on the Library\" means \
either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to \
say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or \
with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. \

files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the \
library.\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered \
by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program \
using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is \
covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library \
(independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether \
that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses \
the Library does.\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete \
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously \

License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this \

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, \
thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such \
modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you \
also meet all of these conditions:\
\>", "LicenseText"],

c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all \
third parties under the terms of this License.\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of \
data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other \
than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a \
good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply \
such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever \
part of its purpose remains meaningful.\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose \
that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, \
Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used \
by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the \
square root function must still compute square roots.)\

Cell["\<\
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable \
sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably \
considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, \
and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as \
separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole \
which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be \
on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to \
the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\

the Library.\

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with \
the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or \

3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License \
instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must \
alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the \
ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License.  \

the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software \
interchange.\

Cell["\<\
If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a \

5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but \

of such executables.\

When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file that \

the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not \
precisely defined by law.\

code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)\

Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the \

you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to \
satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other \
pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the \
Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit \
royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies \
directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both \
it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the \

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to \

Cell["\<\
This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially \
designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software \
Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we \
suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary \
General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, \
based on the explanations below. \
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not \
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have \
the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this \
service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want \
it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free \
programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things. \
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors \
to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These \
restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute \
copies of the library or if you modify it. \
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a \
fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must \
make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link \
other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the \
recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making \
changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms \
so they know their rights. \
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, \
and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, \
distribute and/or modify the library. \
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no \
warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone \
else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the \
original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be \
affected by problems that might be introduced by others. \
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free \
program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the \
users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent \
holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version \
of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in \
this license. \
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU \
General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, \
applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the \
ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in \
order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs. \
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared \
library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a \
derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License \
therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its \
criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax \
criteria for linking other code with the library. \
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it does \
Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. \
It also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over \
competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the \
ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser \
license provides advantages in certain special circumstances. \
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the \
widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto \
standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the \
library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as \
widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by \
limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General \
Public License. \
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs \
enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For \
example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables \
many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its \
variant, the GNU/Linux operating system. \
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' \
freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the \

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification \

\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program \

party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General \
Public License (also called \"this License\"). Each licensee is addressed as \
\"you\". \

A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared \
so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of \
those functions and data) to form executables. \
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work which has \
been distributed under these terms. A \"work based on the Library\" means \
either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to \

with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. \

\"modification\".) \

Cell["\<\
\"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making \
modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source \
code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition \
files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the \
library. \
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered \
by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program \
using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is \
covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library \
(independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether \
that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses \
the Library does. \
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete \
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously \
and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and \
disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this \
License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this \
License along with the Library. \

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, \
thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such \
modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you \
also meet all of these conditions: \
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["a) The modified work must itself be a software library. ", "LicenseText"],

b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that \
you changed the files and the date of any change. \

Cell["\<\
c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all \
third parties under the terms of this License. \
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of \
data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other \
than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a \
good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply \
such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever \
part of its purpose remains meaningful. \
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose \
that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, \
Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used \
by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the \
square root function must still compute square roots.) \
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable \
sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably \
considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, \
and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as \
separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole \
which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be \
on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to \
the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. \
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your \
rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the \
right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on \
the Library. \

Cell["\<\
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with \
the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or \
distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this \
License. \

Cell["\<\
3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License \
instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must \
alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the \
ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. \

has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not \
make any other change in these notices. \

Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, \
so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies \

This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library \
into a program that is not a library. \

4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, \
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of \
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete \
corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under \
the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software \
interchange. \
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a \
designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code \
from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, \
even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the \
object code. \

Cell["\<\
5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but \
is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is \
called a \"work that uses the Library\". Such a work, in isolation, is not a \
derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this \
License. \
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library creates an \
executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions \
of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the library\". The executable \
is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution \
of such executables. \
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file that \
is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work \
of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is \
especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if \
the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not \
precisely defined by law. \
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts \
and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less \
in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of \
whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object \
code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.) \

Cell["\<\
Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the \
object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables \
containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are \
linked directly with the Library itself. \

Cell["\<\
6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a \
\"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a work containing \
portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, \
provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's \
own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications. \
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is \
used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You \
must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays \
copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library \
among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this \
License. Also, you must do one of these things: \

Cell["\<\
a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source \
code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which \
must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an \
executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work \
that uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the user \
can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable \
containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes \
the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able \
to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.) \
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A \
suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library \
already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library \
functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified \
version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified \
version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with. \
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, \
to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a \
charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution. \

Cell["\<\
d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a \
designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified \
materials from the same place. \

Cell["\<\
e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or \
that you have already sent this user a copy. \

Cell["\<\
For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the Library\" \
must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the \
executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be \
distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either \
source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so \
on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that \
component itself accompanies the executable. \

It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of \
other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating \
system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library \
together in an executable that you distribute. \

7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library \
side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not \
covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided \
that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the \
other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do \
these two things: \

it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the \

8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library \
except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to \
copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and \

9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. \
However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the \
Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you \
do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the \
Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of \
this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, \

10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the \
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original \
licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to \

the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not \
responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License. \

11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent \
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), \
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or \
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse \
you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to \
satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other \
pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the \
Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit \
royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies \
directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both \
it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the \
Library. \
