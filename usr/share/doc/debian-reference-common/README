Thank you installing debian-reference (DR).

This family of documentation packages have their contents in:

  /usr/share/doc/debian-reference-common/README          (this file)
  /usr/share/debian-reference/*                          (main contents)
  /usr/share/pixmaps/debian-reference.png                (icons)

These are used by /usr/bin/debian-reference command.

== BUGS ==

If you find any issues or shortcomings of this DR, please file bug reports
using the "reportbug" command against the "debian-reference" package.
 $ reportbug --src debian-reference

For bug reports, it is strongly recommended to write what you want as
alternative.  "It does not work...", "I can do this...", etc. are not so
useful.  An explicit statement such as "The section 9.3.3 should be rewritten
as ...." is desiarable style.  (I do not wish to spend time to guess/search
where you see issues.)

For simple grammar errors and spell errors, diff -u against plain text file or
the source file are most appreciated.

See also, http://bugs.debian.org for how Debian BTS works.

Of course, updating Debian DDP git repository by joining the alioth Debian
documentation (ddp) project https://alioth.debian.org/projects/ddp/ is most
appreciated.  Please also contact us at the Debian documentation project
<debian-doc@lists.debian.org> .

Translation for German is partial and translations for many other languages
are missing.  Your help of creating and updating is most appreciated.

Due to bugs in the tool chain for PDF generation, PDF files are missing.  If
you find solutions to this problem, please file bugs with patch to the
pertinent tool chain packages.

== SOURCE ==

This source is maintained in the alioth ddp debian-reference git repository as
indicated in the Vcs-Git and Vcs-Browse control fields.
