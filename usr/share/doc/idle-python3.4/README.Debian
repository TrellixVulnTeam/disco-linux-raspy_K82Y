  The Python IDLE package for Debian
  ----------------------------------

This package contains Python 3.4's Integrated DeveLopment Environment, IDLE.

IDLE is included in the Python 3.4 upstream distribution (Tools/idle) and
depends on Tkinter (available as python3.4-tk package).

I have written a simple man page.
